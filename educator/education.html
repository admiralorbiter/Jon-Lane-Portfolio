        <h1>My Journey as an Educator</h1>
        <h2>From Programmer to Educator</h2>
        <p>My passion for learning has been a constant companion, igniting a spark in me from a young age. In elementary school, I read ahead in the math book about multiplication of big numbers. In that moment I felt like a god, holding knowledge my peers didn't understand and would take their time learning. My friend Chris, also eager to learn, spent a recess with me teaching him how to multiple large digit numbers. That year I would also arrange my toys as a class to teach them to teach them math, unfortunately none would pass the state exam.</p>
        <p>The idea of being a teacher always appealed to me, especially at a young age as school was the most consistent thing I had in my life. That idea further planted in middle and high school as I absolutely loved learning and would frequently be asked to help support my peer's learning. However, during my junior year when I asked guidance from my teacher if I should pursue education he told me it would be a 'waste of my talents'.
        </p>
        <p>So I poured all my attention into computer science. I started a bachelors at KU in computer science in Fall 2008. That is when life threw me another curve ball, this time destroying the path I had planned. During my freshmen semester, I suffered multi-organ failure. That event set off a chain reaction of events that would end up having to change my major or leave KU. I was committed to Lawrence and a girl at the time, so I decided to join the math program. In my search for a valuable major, I was introduced to the UKanTeach program, which could be done in conjunction with my degree. I wasn't sure I wanted to be a teacher, but at the end of the day I would still have my math degree.
        </p>
        <p>Many didn't seem to view me as a teacher, and to be honest, I wasn't so sure I saw myself in that role either. It felt like life had just sort of nudged me here. I wasn't half out, but more like just a toe testing the waters. Some of the first feedback I received suggested that my evaluator was a bit worried about whether I'd be likable enough. Initial experiences with students were okay, but there is no real way to prepare you for what teaching actual is until student teaching.
        </p>
        <p>Student teaching didn't hit me like some of my other peers that it completely flattened. I was already immersed in the lifestyle though my future wife who I was dating at the time so I was prepared for the workload. In fact for me, student teaching was the first real time I felt connected to the work. It was the first time I could fully understand what teaching was including all the good and bad.
        </p>
        <p>My commitment only solidified once I got my own classroom. That first year in the classroom was the most difficult but fun year of my professional life. From there, I was lucky to get a teaching position for a non-profit for computer science and technology for juniors and seniors. 
        </p>
        <p>There isn't a week that goes by that I don't about when my high school math teacher told me it would be a 'waste of talent' to be a teacher. Was that tongue in cheek? Did he really believe that? Having worked and seen what it takes to be a well-paid programmer vs teaching day to day, I can tell you that there is no comparison. There aren't a ton of harder jobs than teaching  and for some the rare (non-monetary) rewards make it worth it.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, at the time I write this, everyone I know in the classroom is trying to exit or have already exited. This is a job I love and others love, yet it has become unsustainable. While the profession we know and love is dying off, it is the students that make this job worth it. 
        </p>
        <p>While as of 2023 my role has changed so I no longer directly responsible for students. I work out of their classroom, occasionally lecture, answer the harder tech questions and often collaborate with students on projects. I've worked to ensure as I continue my work, I can stay attached to the student experience. And as much as I am a lifelong learning, I'm also a lifelong educator.
