        <h1>My Journey as an Educator</h1>
        <h2>From Programmer to Educator</h2>
        <p>My passion for learning has always been a steadfast companion, sparking a flame within me since childhood. I recall in elementary school, poring over the math book and discovering the multiplication of large numbers. In that instant, I felt empowered, privy to a secret wisdom my classmates had yet to grasp. My friend Chris, equally keen to learn, joined me during a recess where I showed him the ropes of multiplying big digits. That year, I even set up my toys as students to teach them math, although regrettably, they fell short of passing the state exam.</p>

        <p>The notion of teaching has always held allure for me. It was the most reliable aspect of my young life, and this attraction only grew through middle and high school, where my love for learning was unmistakable. My peers often sought my help, reinforcing the idea of teaching as a calling. But in junior year, a teacher advised me against pursuing education, suggesting it would be a 'waste of my talents'.</p>
        
        <p>Redirecting my energies, I dove headlong into computer science, commencing a bachelor's at KU in the fall of 2008. But life had other plans, throwing a wrench in my carefully laid path with multi-organ failure during my freshman year. Faced with a stark choice, I decided to remain in Lawrence, tied by my commitment to a relationship and switched to a math major. It was through this transition that I discovered the UKanTeach program, an opportunity to explore teaching while securing my math degree.</p>
        
        <p>Many couldn't picture me as a teacher, and frankly, I had my doubts as well. Life seemed to have gently pushed me in this direction. When I began receiving feedback, some expressed concern over my potential likability. Engaging with students was one thing, but nothing could truly prep you for the real deal like student teaching.</p>
        
        <p>Student teaching was a profound experience, it wasn't overwhelming as it was for some peers; I felt ready for the challenge, thanks to insights gained from my future wife. That's when teaching really clicked for me—the mixture of triumphs and trials was tangible and alluring.</p>
        
        <p>The resolve to teach only strengthened once I got my own classroom. My first year was a whirlwind of challenge and enjoyment, and it propelled me to my current role with a nonprofit, shaping computer science education for upperclassmen.</p>
        
        <p>I often ponder over my high school math teacher's words about teaching being a 'waste of talent'. What did he truly mean? Now, with the experience of both the programming and teaching worlds, I understand there's no comparison. Teaching is arduous, yet its unique, non-financial rewards are incomparable.</p>
        
        <p>At present, the profession I love is waning, with many colleagues departing from what seems an untenable path. Nonetheless, it's the students who continue to make this vocation worthwhile.</p>
        
        <p>In 2023, my role evolved, stepping back from direct classroom involvement to supporting from the sidelines—lecturing occasionally, tackling complex tech inquiries, and partnering with students on projects. My aim is to remain connected to the student experience, ensuring my journey as a lifelong learner forever intertwines with being a lifelong educator.</p>
