        <h1>Lawrence High School</h1>
        <p>I taught math and computer science which broke down into 4 different preps: Advance Algebra 2, Algebra 2, Intro to CS, Advance CS. This was my first year teaching, so I had a tenuous grasp on the students at times.</p>
        <img alt="white board that has pictures and says 'get tow work'" src="pics/whiteboard-gettowork.jpg" width="100%" height="100%" />
        <p>My white board became a place for student creativity. All it took the spark of one student to start drawing on the board and others took off. Throughout the year I would have to clear them, but that didn't stop the artists from continuing their work.
            I love the idea of impermanence and white board was a great reminder.
