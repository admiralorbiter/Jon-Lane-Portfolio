          <p>I began my journey in web development in 2001, when I was in 6th grade, thanks to a family computer purchased by my uncle. From 2001 to 2008, I devoted my free time to mastering HTML 4.0 and CSS3, creating websites on a Gateway computer using dial-up internet. My initial web projects were guild websites for World of Warcraft, which sparked my interest in more complex features, eventually leading to learning PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript to develop full-stack applications.</p>

          <p>These skills were honed through countless interactions on message boards and chat rooms, where I sought and shared advice. By my senior year of high school, I had started to earn money through contract work, developing simple applications for volunteer management among other tasks. Although I later shifted towards software development with Java and C++, I continued freelance WordPress projects until 2016 and still maintain several sites voluntarily, keeping connected with the WordPress community.</p>

          <p>Since 2016, my professional role has heavily involved web development. I've taught multiple courses and led projects, deepening my expertise in HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap by developing from official documentation. My projects have included major event websites and significant redesigns of our main organizational site.</p>

          <p>Recently, I've embraced a streamlined stack for frontend development using HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, and HTMX, with SQLite for databases (switching to PostgreSQL when necessary). For backend development, I prefer Flask or Django. This setup has enabled me to create sophisticated web applications, some of which have been collaborative projects with high school students.</p>
