          <h3>The Hound Proof of Concept</h3>
          <p>The Hound is a series of initial projects laying the groundwork for a larger RPG game, designed using the libGDX framework. These projects, coded in Java with some Kotlin elements, highlight critical gameplay mechanics that will be integral to the final game. This includes a sophisticated dialogue system, interaction with NPCs, and a dynamic inventory management system.</p>
          <p>Additionally, the proof of concept features enhancements like speed boosts for characters, a system for highlighting objects with mouse movement, and a detailed collision and movement system. A notable aspect is the exploration of building interiors and item acquisitions which enrich the gameplay environment. Another project version focuses on a non-GUI magic system, offering complex interactions and an advanced NPC engagement model.</p>

          <h2>Gloomhaven Proof of Concept</h2>
          <p>"Secret---RPG" is a digital adaptation of the board game Gloomhaven, currently developed as a proof of concept for the first level. The project, implemented in Java, showcases basic functionalities of the game, adapting complex board game mechanics into a digital format. Despite being in its early stages and containing bugs, it provides a foundation for further development and expansion.</p>
          <p>This project currently supports a few character classes and has successfully demonstrated the ability to run scenarios with basic gameplay elements. It serves as a valuable learning experience and a stepping stone towards a more polished and comprehensive RPG adaptation.</p>

      <h1>Java Game Dev Projects Overview</h1>
      <p>The "Java Game Dev Projects" repository showcases a collection of older game development projects, each demonstrating a specific game mechanic or concept. These projects are primarily implemented in Java and serve as a proof of concept for various game dynamics such as collision detection, pathfinding, resource management, and game AI development.</p>
      <p>Significant projects include 'Lovecraft Crossing', a complex game mechanic simulator, and 'Mistborn', a 2D platformer. Each project is briefly described and provides insight into the application of various algorithms and game development principles.</p>
