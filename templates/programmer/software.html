    <div class="story-section">
        <p>From the moment we got a family computer, a generous gift from my uncle when I was in 6th grade, my fascination with programming took root. I devoted three years to mastering Visual Basic 6, crafting innovative applications for Yahoo and AOL chat services.</p>

        <p>In 2010, I embarked on my professional journey as a Java developer, creating sophisticated software solutions for an auto repair shop. This role marked the beginning of a deep engagement with Spring Boot and a variety of other Java frameworks that significantly expanded my technical repertoire.</p>
    
        <p>Since 2016, I've shifted my focus towards nurturing the next generation of programmers by teaching high school students and developing web-based applications. My programming adventures continue as I extensively use Python, which has become my preferred backend language, proving essential in both educational settings and professional development projects.</p>
